* Renamed to SponeWM.
* Removed prompt stuff.
* Removed all decorations besides Nada.
* Created a new decoration that uses images for borders,
  resulting in one decoration type that can be used for
  simple borders, titlebars on every side and infitly more posibilities.
* Removed different tiling layouts, and added a fibbonaci one.
* Added support for tiling padding and gaps.
* Made floating windows spawn under the cursor instead of randomly.
* Made floating and tiling layout more similar, for example both use list now.
  This result in easy future tiling options, for example you can make a new
  master window simply by moving the window id to the fron of the list.
* Removed lots of safety stuff I don't really care about, the user should be smarter, lol.
* Removed hooks.
* Moved from a .wini config to a .json config.
* Removed hotkey stuff, this is a WM, not a hotkey daemon, use sxhkd or something.
